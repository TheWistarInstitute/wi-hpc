# Apptainer

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) is a container software similar to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) that is specifically designed for use in HPC enviornments.

Please see https://hpc.apps.wistar.org/guide/containers/ for more information on the usage of container in the WI-HPC cluster.

Each folder will container a definition file (`.def`) that is used to build a container with the `apptainer build` command.
